Gender recognition and classification by voice
Project
This project aims to address the question of whether the gender of a speaker can be predicted solely from voice parameters. The database for my analysis was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/primaryobjects/voicegender?select=voice.csv and contains twenty voice parameters with a column of binary labels (female - male). The dataset is based on 3168 voice samples. Is a neural network able to predict the gender of a speaker with over 90% accuracy?

Results
The results of the training are encouraging and clearly show that the model is able to predict the gender of a speaker based on the given parameters with an accuracy of over 96%. 
 
The comparison between the prediction and the test data also shows on the test data that the model was able to predict the gender of a voice with an accuracy of 97%. The error level of the model on the test data was 0.91%.
